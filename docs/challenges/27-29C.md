<blockquote><ol>
<li>Trying to access a non-existent field on an object immediately aborts the entire VM. The user has no way to recover from this runtime error, nor is there any way to see if a field exists before trying to access it. It’s up to the user to ensure on their own that only valid fields are read.<br>
How do other dynamically typed languages handle missing fields? What do you think Lox should do? Implement your solution.</li>

<li>Fields are accessed at runtime by their string name. But that name must always appear directly in the source code as an identifier token. A user program cannot imperatively build a string value and then use that as the name of a field. Do you think they should be able to? Devise a language feature that enables that and implement it.</li>

<li>Conversely, Lox offers no way to remove a field from an instance. You can set a field’s value to nil, but the entry in the hash table is still there. How do other languages handle this? Choose and implement a strategy for Lox.</li>

<li>Because fields are accessed by name at runtime, working with instance state is slow. It’s technically a constant-time operation—thanks, hash tables—but the constant factors are relatively large. This is a major component of why dynamic languages are slower than statically typed ones.<br>
How do sophisticated implementations of dynamically typed languages cope with and optimize this?</li>

**TODO: add native functions hasField, getField, setField, deleteField for all user-defined classes.**

I am unsure of whether to add these as native functions or native *methods.* Native methods make the interface for calling cleaner but produces some *jank* if users decide to shadow them. I want these to be available at all times.

Calling these functions for non-instances should return an Exception object.

As for `4.`, some rudimentary research indicates:

- Python instances share the same hash table for fields ala. database-style. Whenever a new instance is created, another 'column' is added, whereas the rows store the fields themselves. Because Python allows for field declarations inside classes, the compiler has a pretty good idea on the minimum size of the table, even as it grows due to new instances and new dynamically-inserted fields.

- Some just-in-time compilers implement type-checking for native types they can use optimized solutions for, and a fallback option for more general usecases (such as overloading the `+` operator for non-numeric types).  
  *Source: [StackExchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/419714/how-are-dynamic-and-static-typings-implemented).*
  - I imagine this could also be done for field access if fields are declared in the class body: allocate space for declared fields so that we can just use pointer offsets to access them. Otherwise, use a hash table for dynamically-set fields.

<li>The hash table lookup to find a class’s init() method is constant time, but still fairly slow. Implement something faster. Write a benchmark and measure the performance difference.</li>

<li>In a dynamically typed language like Lox, a single callsite may invoke a variety of methods on a number of classes throughout a program’s execution. Even so, in practice, most of the time a callsite ends up calling the exact same method on the exact same class for the duration of the run. Most calls are actually not polymorphic even if the language says they can be.<br>
How do advanced language implementations optimize based on that observation?</li>

<li>When interpreting an OP_INVOKE instruction, the VM has to do two hash table lookups. First, it looks for a field that could shadow a method, and only if that fails does it look for a method. The former check is rarely useful—most fields do not contain functions. But it is necessary because the language says fields and methods are accessed using the same syntax, and fields shadow methods.<br>
That is a language choice that affects the performance of our implementation. Was it the right choice? If Lox were your language, what would you do?</li>

None of these are to be implemented, other than *maybe* 28-1.

For 28-3, I don't think this is a *wrong* choice? But it is certainly less efficient than a more typical implementation though. Not that big of a fan of Wren's fields leading with underscore, though. IMO that's a bit of an arbitrary design choice, and design choices are what lead to the inscrutable monolith that is Python.

If I made Lox my own, I'd probably include field declarations in the class body, and make setting a non-existent field a runtime error (unless you use the more explicit `setField` function). Then again I would also do a lot of things. Like type-checking.
